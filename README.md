# Machine-Learning-spring-2022

implemented By Soheil Abadifard and Maria Raluca Duminica

### this Implementation used pseudo-codes of An improved Stacking framework for stock index prediction by leveraging tree-based ensemble models and deep learning algorithms
 
All the data is gathered from yahoo finance and federal reserve websites.

In this Implementation, four tree-based ensemble classifiers such as RF, ERT, XGBoost, LightGBM, and 4 Deep learning models such as RNN, BRNN, LSTM, and GRU have been used.

For training the proposed model, cross-validation is employed.

The results o first-level classifiers are gathered together to form new input for meta classifiers.

the proposed model has been tested on Three major stock index in the U.S (Nasdaq, Dow 30, and S&P500)
